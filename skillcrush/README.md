# Welcome to Camp Skillcrush

###### VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

Hello! And welcome to Camp Skillcrush.

My name is Lex, I’m the Head Counselor, and I think you’re going to love it here.

Camp Skillcrush is the awesome, online technology-focused summer camp you’ve always dreamed of.

First of all, we’re not one of those hardcore, no fun, coding bootcamps. No. Here at Skillcrush, we believe anyone can succeed in the tech industry and everyone should get the opportunity.

But we’re also not a traditional summer camp. Instead of swimming in the lake or having a food fight in the mess hall, you’ll be doing fun things like coding and designing websites.

Skillcrush is an online tech education company with a mission. To empower our students with the technical skills they need to enter high earning and flexible careers in tech.

In fact, our Founder and CEO, Adda Birnir, created the company with the goal of making technology and tech work as accessible, inclusive, and affordable as possible.

As you no doubt know, technology is a huge part of all of our lives which is why we believe so strongly that tech has to belong to ALL OF US.

And in order for that to happen, the tech industry needs to be diverse, equitable, and inclusive, which is to say, tech should be a place where you feel safe, supported, respected, and valued for exactly who you are.

And that also means that working in tech should be possible for everyone who is passionate about technology, no matter their race, ethnicity, age, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or nationality.

So, how does that relate to Camp Skillcrush?

Well, Camp Skillcrush plays a key role in that mission because it’s where you can learn all about how Skillcrush works, what programs we have to offer, what our teaching style is like, and decide if you think Skillcrush could be a good fit for you and your career plans.

So we’re going to work hard during your time at Camp Skillcrush to convince you that the only qualification you need to embark on a journey into tech is passion for technology and the ways in which it can make the world a better place.

In other words, Skillcrush is a place where we hope you will feel safe, supported, respected, and valued for exactly who you are.

Camp will also give you the opportunity to start actually learning some skills, including coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the fundamentals of designing for the web.

I’ll get into all of that in a minute but before I do, I wanna tell you about something that is super important to us here at Skillcrush: SUPPORT! We’re all about it!

In practice, this means that throughout your Skillcrush journey, even now as a camper, you’re going to have access to some of the friendliest, most helpful instructors, mentors, career coaches, and enrollment counselors in the business.

So hop on over to the next step and start your Camp Skillcrush adventure.

<h1>Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now</h1> 
<p>Author: Maya Angelou</p>
<p>Human beings are more alike than unalike, and what is true anywhere is true everywhere, yet I encourage travel to as many destinations as possible for the sake of education as well as pleasure...by demonstrating that all people cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try to understand each other, we may even become friends.</p>

<h1>Work Locations</h1>
<h2>Remote</h2>
<p>Remote work often means a company may or may not have a physical office, and you can work for the company from <em>virtually anywhere.</em></p>
<h2>On-Site</h2>
<p>On-site jobs are the most common type and require employees to <strong>be in the office physically.</strong></p>
<h2>Choosing a Location</h2>
<p>When looking for jobs in design and development, consider each work location and how it <strong>matches your needs</strong>.</p>
