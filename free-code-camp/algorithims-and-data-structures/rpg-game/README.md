## Learn JavasScript by Building a Role Playing Game

Step 1
JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive.

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body.

Step 2
Create four div elements within your #game element. Give them the following respective id values, in order: stats, controls, monsterStats, and text.
