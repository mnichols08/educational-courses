## Learn JavasScript by Building a Role Playing Game

Step 1
JavaScript is a powerful language which allows you to build websites that are interactive.

To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body.

Step 2
Create four div elements within your #game element. Give them the following respective id values, in order: stats, controls, monsterStats, and text.

Step 3
Create three span elements within your #stats element. Give each of them the class stat. Then give the first one the text XP: 0, the second one the text Health: 100, and the third one the text Gold: 50.

Step 4
Wrap the numbers 0, 100, and 50 in span elements, and wrap those new span elements in strong elements. Then give your new span elements id values of xpText, healthText, and goldText, respectively.
