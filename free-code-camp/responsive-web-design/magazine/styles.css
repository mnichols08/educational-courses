/* Step 26
To start your CSS, normalize the CSS rules by targeting all elements with *, including the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors.

Set the padding and margin properties both to 0 and set the box-sizing property to border-box.

Step 27
Create an html selector and give it a font-size property set to 62.5%. This will set the default font size for your web page to 10px (the browser default is 16px).

This will make it easier for you to work with rem units later, as 2rem would be 20px.

Step 28
Create a body selector. Set the font-family property to Baskervville, with a fallback of serif. Set the color property to linen and the background-color property to rgb(20, 30, 40).
