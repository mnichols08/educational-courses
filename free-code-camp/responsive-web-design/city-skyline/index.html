<!-- 
Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>City Skyline</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
