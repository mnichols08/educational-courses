<!-- 
Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 8
Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings.

Step 10.1
Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. 

Step 11
Nest four div elements in the .bb1 container. Give them the classes bb1a, bb1b, bb1c, and bb1d in that order. This building will have four sections.

Step 18
Your first building looks pretty good now. Nest three new div elements in the .background-buildings container and give them the classes of bb2, bb3, and bb4 in that order. These will be three more buildings for the background.

Step 21
The buildings are too spaced out. Squeeze them together by adding two empty div elements to the top of the .background-buildings element, two more at the bottom of it, and one more in between .bb3 and .bb4. These will be added as evenly-spaced elements across the container, effectively moving the buildings closer to the center.

Step 28
The background buildings are starting to look pretty good. Create a new div below the .background-buildings element and give it a class of foreground-buildings. This will be another container for more buildings.

Step 30
Nest six div elements within .foreground-buildings and give them the classes of fb1 through fb6 in that order. "fb" stands for "foreground building". These will be six more buildings for the foreground.

Step 36
Squeeze the buildings together again by adding two empty div elements within both the top and bottom of the .foreground-buildings element, and one more in between .fb2 and .fb3.

Step 42
Add the new bb1-window class to the .bb1a, .bb1b, and .bb1c elements. This will apply the gradient to them.

Step 48
Nest two new div elements within .bb2, give them the classes of bb2a and bb2b, in that order. These will be two sections for this building.

Step 62
The next building will have three sections. Nest three div elements within .bb4. Give them the classes of bb4a, bb4b and bb4c in that order.

Step 67
Add the new building-wrap class to the .bb1 and .bb4 elements. This will apply the centering properties to the buildings that need it.

Step 69
Nest four new div elements within .bb4c, give them all the class of bb4-window. These will be windows for this building.

Step 72
Add the new window-wrap class to the .bb4c element.

Step 73
Looks good! On to the foreground buildings! Turn the .fb1 building into three sections by nesting three new div elements within it. Give them the classes of fb1a, fb1b and fb1c, in that order.
