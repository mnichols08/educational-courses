<!-- 
Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 8
Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings.

Step 10.1
Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. 

Step 11
Nest four div elements in the .bb1 container. Give them the classes bb1a, bb1b, bb1c, and bb1d in that order. This building will have four sections.

Step 18
Your first building looks pretty good now. Nest three new div elements in the .background-buildings container and give them the classes of bb2, bb3, and bb4 in that order. These will be three more buildings for the background.
