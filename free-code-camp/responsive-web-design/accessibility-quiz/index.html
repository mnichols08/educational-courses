Step 15
To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

Give each of the section elements the region role. 


Step 16
Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.

Add the following aria-labelledby attributes to the section elements:

student-info
html-questions
css-questions
Then, within each section element, nest one h2 element with an id matching the corresponding aria-labelledby attribute. Give each h2 suitable text content. -->
<!-- Step 18
To be able to navigate within the page, give each anchor element an href corresponding to the id of the h2 elements. 

Step 18
To be able to navigate within the page, give each anchor element an href corresponding to the id of the h2 elements.

Step 19
Filling out the content of the quiz, below #student-info, add three div elements with a class of info.

Then, within each div nest one label element, and one input element.

Step 20
It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element. This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.

This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of the input.

This section will take a student's name, email address, and date of birth. Give the label elements appropriate for attributes, as well as text content. Then, link the input elements to the corresponding label elements.

Step 21
Keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, give each input an appropriate type and name attribute. Then, give the first input a placeholder attribute.

Step 22
Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.

Remove the placeholder text from the first input element, relying on the label being the best-practice.

Step 23
Arguably, D.O.B. is not descriptive enough. This is especially true for visually impaired users. One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the label, is to add text only a screen reader can read.

Append a span element with a class of sr-only to the current text content of the third label element.

Step 24
Within the span element, add the text (Date of Birth).

Step 26
Within the second section element, add two div elements with a class of question-block.

Then, within each div.question-block element, add one p element with text of incrementing numbers, starting at 1, and one fieldset element with a class of question.

Step 27
Each fieldset will contain a true/false question.

Within each fieldset, nest one legend element, and one ul element with two options.

Step 28
Give each fieldset an adequate name attribute. Then, give both unordered lists a class of answers-list.

Finally, use the legend to caption the content of the fieldset by placing a true/false question as the text content.

Step 29
To provide the functionality of the true/false questions, we need a set of inputs which do not allow both to be selected at the same time.

Within each list element, nest one label element, and within each label element, nest one input element with the appropriate type.

Step 30
Add an id to all of your radio inputs so you can link your labels to them. Give the first one an id of q1-a1. Give the rest of them ids of q1-a2, q2-a1, and q2-a2, respectively.

Step 31
Although not required for label elements with a nested input, it is still best-practice to explicitly link a label with its corresponding input element.

Now, add a for attribute to each of your four labels that links the label to its corresponding radio input.

Step 32
Give the label elements text such that the input comes before the text. Then, give the input elements a value matching the text.

The text should either be True or False.

Step 33
If you click on the radio inputs, you might notice both inputs within the same true/false fieldset can be selected at the same time.

Group the relevant inputs together such that only one input from a pair can be selected at a time.

Step 35
The final section of this quiz will contain a dropdown, and a text box.

Begin by nesting a div with a class of formrow, and nest four div elements inside of it, alternating their class attributes with question-block and answer.
