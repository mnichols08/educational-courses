You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this course, you'll build a penguin. You'll use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animate your work.

Step 1
You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.

Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the DOCTYPE declaration, html element with a language set to English, the appropriate meta tags, a head, body, and title element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

Step 6
Within the body, add a div with a class of ground.

Step 10
Above the .ground element, add a div with a class of penguin. This div will contain Flappy Penguin.

Step 13
To create some scenery in the background, you will add two mountains.

Above the .penguin element, add a div with a class of left-mountain.

Step 19
To give the effect of a mountain range, add another mountain, by creating a new div immediately after .left-mountain, and give the new div the class of back-mountain.

Step 24
To finish the background, add a sun, by creating a new div element immediately after the .back-mountain element, and give it the class of sun.

Step 28
Your penguin will consist of two main sections: the head, and the body.

Within .penguin, add two new div elements. The first with a class of penguin-head, and the second with a class of penguin-body.

Step 44
Start the penguin's face, by adding two div elements within .penguin-head, and giving them both a class of face.

Step 48
Currently, the two .face elements are on top of each other.

Fix this, by adding a class of left to the first .face element, and a class of right to the second .face element.

Step 51
Below the .face.right element, add a div element with a class of chin.

Step 56
Below the .chin element, add two div elements each with a class of eye. Also, give the first .eye element a class of left, and the second .eye element a class of right.

Step 60
Within each .eye element, add a div with a class of eye-lid.

Step 63
Below the .eye.right element, add two div elements each with a class of blush. Also, give the first .blush element a class of left, and the second .blush element a class of right.

Step 67
Below the .blush.right element, add two div elements each with a class of beak. Also, give the first .beak element a class of top, and the second .beak element a class of bottom.

Step 71
The penguin's body looks a bit plain. Spruce him up by adding a div element with a class of shirt, immediately before the .penguin-body element.

Step 72
Within the .shirt element, add a div with the following emoji as content: ðŸ’œ

Step 73
Within .shirt, after the div element, add a p element with the following content: I CSS

Step 79
Fun fact: Penguins cannot stand without at least two feet.

Within the .penguin-body element, add two div elements each with a class of foot. Give the first .foot a class of left, and the second .foot a class of right.

Step 86
Fun fact: Penguins cannot fly without wings.

Within .penguin-body, before the .foot elements, add two div elements each with a class of arm. Give the first .arm a class of left, and the second .arm a class of right.
