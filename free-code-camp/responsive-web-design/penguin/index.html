You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this course, you'll build a penguin. You'll use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animate your work.

Step 1
You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.

Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the DOCTYPE declaration, html element with a language set to English, the appropriate meta tags, a head, body, and title element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

Step 6
Within the body, add a div with a class of ground.

Step 10
Above the .ground element, add a div with a class of penguin. This div will contain Flappy Penguin.

Step 13
To create some scenery in the background, you will add two mountains.

Above the .penguin element, add a div with a class of left-mountain.

Step 19
To give the effect of a mountain range, add another mountain, by creating a new div immediately after .left-mountain, and give the new div the class of back-mountain.
