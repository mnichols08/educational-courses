/* 
Step 4
Use the universal selector to add box-sizing: border-box; to your CSS. This ensures elements include padding and border in their specified width and height.

Step 5
Give your body element a background-color of #c9d2fc.

Step 7
Using a class selector, give the .cat-head element a width of 205px and a height of 180px. Also, give it a border of 1px solid #000 and a border-radius of 46%.

Step 8
To see the cat-head element, give it a linear gradient background with #5e5e5e at 85% and #45454f at 100%.

You might not notice the difference between these two colors, but they are there.
