Step 4
Use the universal selector to add box-sizing: border-box; to your CSS. This ensures elements include padding and border in their specified width and height.

Step 5
Give your body element a background-color of #c9d2fc.

Step 7
Using a class selector, give the .cat-head element a width of 205px and a height of 180px. Also, give it a border of 1px solid #000 and a border-radius of 46%.

Step 8
To see the cat-head element, give it a linear gradient background with #5e5e5e at 85% and #45454f at 100%.

You might not notice the difference between these two colors, but they are there.

Step 9
CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be positioned in the browser. It has a position property you can set to static, absolute, relative, sticky or fixed.

Once you set the position property of the element, you can move the element around by setting a pixel or a percentage value for one or more of the top, right, left, or bottom properties.

static is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign it to an element, you won't be able to move it around with top, right, left, or bottom.

Give .cat-head a position property of static, then set the top and left properties to 100px each.
