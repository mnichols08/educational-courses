<!-- 
Step 1
Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a DOCTYPE reference of html and an html element with its lang attribute set to en. Also, add a head and a body element within the html element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute of utf-8. Also add a title element with the text fCC Cat Painting.

Step 3
Add a link element within your head element. For that link element, set the rel attribute to stylesheet and the href to ./styles.css.

 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>fCC Cat Painting</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
