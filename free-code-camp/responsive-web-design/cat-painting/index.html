Step 1
Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a DOCTYPE reference of html and an html element with its lang attribute set to en. Also, add a head and a body element within the html element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute of utf-8. Also add a title element with the text fCC Cat Painting.

Step 3
Add a link element within your head element. For that link element, set the rel attribute to stylesheet and the href to ./styles.css.

Step 6
Back in your HTML, create a main element. Inside that main element, add a div element with the class cat-head.

Step 12
fixed is a position property value that lets you make an element fixed to the page no matter where the user scrolls to on the page.

You'll have to do some more markups to see how fixed positioning works. In your HTML, create a div element with the class box.

Step 17
Remove the div element with class box because you don't need it anymore.

Step 19
Now you should work on the cat's ears. There will be a right and a left ear, and inside each, there will be an inner ear.

Inside your .cat-head element, create a div element with the class cat-ears.

Step 20
Inside your .cat-ears element, create two div elements with the classes cat-left-ear and cat-right-ear respectively.

Step 21
Inside your .cat-left-ear element, create another div element with the class cat-left-inner-ear.

Step 22
Inside your .cat-right-ear element, create another div element with the class cat-right-inner-ear.

Step 40
You will now start working on the cat's eyes. Like the ears, the eyes will have inner eyes.

Create a div element with the class cat-eyes. Inside the cat-eyes element, create two div elements with the class cat-left-eye and cat-right-eye respectively.
