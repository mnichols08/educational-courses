Step 3
Create a selector for your .wheel element. Start by setting the border to 2px solid black, the border-radius to 50%, and the margin-left to 50px.

Step 4
Set the position property of the .wheel selector to absolute. Set the height and width both to 55vw.

Step 5
Give your .wheel selector a max-height and max-width property both set to 500px.

Step 6
Create a selector for your .line elements. Start by setting the background-color to black, the width to 50%, and the height to 2px.

Step 7
Set the .line selector's position property to absolute, the left property to 50%, and the top property to 50%.

Step 8
The transform-origin property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is applied. For example, when performing a rotate (which you will do later in this project), the transform-origin determines around which point the element is rotated.

Give the .line selector a transform-origin property of 0% 0%. This will offset the origin point by 0% from the left and 0% from the top, setting it to the top left corner of the element.

Step 9
Create a selector to target your second .line element. Set the transform property to rotate(60deg).

Remember that the transform property allows you to manipulate the shape of an element. In this case, using the rotate(60deg) value will rotate the element around its transform-origin point by 60 degrees clockwise.

Step 10
Using the same pattern, create a separate selector for the third .line, the fourth .line, the fifth .line, and the sixth .line.

Set the transform property for the third .line to rotate(120deg), the fourth to rotate(180deg), the fifth to rotate(240deg), and the sixth to rotate(300deg)

Step 11
Create a .cabin selector. Set the background-color to red, the width to 20%, and the height to 20%.

Step 12
Give the .cabin a position of absolute, and a border of 2px solid.

Step 13
Set the .cabin to have a transform-origin property of 50% 0%. This will set the origin point to be offset 50% from the left and 0% from the top, placing it in the middle of the top edge of the element.

Step 14
Time to position the cabins around the wheel. Select the first .cabin element. Set the right property to -8.5% and the top property to 50%.

Step 15
Continuing the pattern, select the following .cabin elements and apply the specific rules to them:

The second .cabin should have the right property set to 17% and the top property set to 93.5%.
The third .cabin should have the right property set to 67% and the top property set to 93.5%.
The fourth .cabin should have the left property set to -8.5% and the top property set to 50%.
The fifth .cabin should have the left property set to 17% and the top property set to 7%.
The sixth .cabin should have the right property set to 17% and the top property set to 7%.

Step 16
The @keyframes at-rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation. Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points in the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define the start and end of the sequence.

@keyframes rules require a name to be assigned to them, which you use in other rules to reference. For example, the @keyframes freeCodeCamp { } rule would be named freeCodeCamp.

Time to start animating. Create a @keyframes rule named wheel.

Step 17
You now need to define how your animation should start. To do this, create a 0% rule within your @keyframes wheel rule. The properties you set in this nested selector will apply at the beginning of your animation.

As an example, this would be a 12% rule:

@keyframes freecodecamp {
  12% {
    color: green;
  }
}
