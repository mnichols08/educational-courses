React Foundations
To effectively learn Next.js, it helps to be familiar with JavaScript, React, and related web development concepts. But JavaScript and React are vast topics. How do you know when you're ready to start using Next.js?

Welcome to the React Foundations course! This beginner-friendly, example-led course will guide you through the prerequisite knowledge for Next.js. You will build a simple project step-by-step; starting with a JavaScript application, then migrating it to React and Next.js.

Each section builds on the previous one, so you can choose where to start depending on what you already know.

Prerequisite knowledge
This tutorial assumes knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and no knowledge of React. If you're already familiar with React, you can skip to the From React to Next.js chapter or take Dashboard App course.

Chapter 1

About React and Next.js
Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast, full-stack web applications.

But what exactly do we mean by this? Let's spend some time expanding on what React and Next.js are and how they can help you build web applications.

Building blocks of a web application
There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.
For each part of your application, you will need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools, such as packages, libraries, and frameworks.

What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

By user interfaces (UI), we mean the elements that users see and interact with on-screen.

By library, we mean React provides helpful functions (APIs) to build UI, but leaves it up to the developer where to use those functions in their application.

Part of React's success is that it is relatively unopinionated about the other aspects of building applications. This has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tools and solutions, including Next.js.

It also means, however, that building a complete React application from the ground up requires some effort. Developers need to spend time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for common application requirements.

What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, you can use React and Next.js to build fully interactive, highly dynamic, and performant web applications.

In the next chapters, we will discuss how you can get started with React and Next.js.

Chapter 2

Rendering User Interfaces (UI)
To understand how React works, we first need a basic understanding of how browsers interpret your code to create (or render) user interfaces (UI).

When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the browser that may look like this:

Two side-by-side diagrams, left showing the HTML code, and right showing the DOM tree.
The browser then reads the HTML and constructs the Document Object Model (DOM).

What is the DOM?
The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.

Two side-by-side diagrams, left showing the DOM tree, and right showing the rendered UI.
You can use DOM methods and JavaScript, to listen to user events and manipulate the DOM by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting specific elements in the user interface. DOM manipulation allows you to not only target specific elements, but also change their style and content.

In the next section you'll learn how to use JavaScript and DOM methods.

Chapter 3

Updating UI with Javascript
In this chapter, we'll start building out our project by using JavaScript and DOM methods to add an h1 tag to your project.

Open your code editor and create a new index.html file. Inside the HTML file, add the following code:

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
Then give the div a unique id so that you can target it later.

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
To write JavaScript inside your HTML file, add a script tag:

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
Now, inside the script tag, you can use a DOM method, getElementById(), to select the <div> element by its id:

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
You can continue using DOM methods to create a new <h1> element:

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Select the div element with 'app' id
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
 
      // Create a new H1 element
      const header = document.createElement('h1');
 
      // Create a new text node for the H1 element
      const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
      const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
 
      // Append the text to the H1 element
      header.appendChild(headerContent);
 
      // Place the H1 element inside the div
      app.appendChild(header);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
To make sure everything is working, open your HTML file inside your browser of choice. You should see an h1 tag that says, 'Develop. Preview. Ship.'.

HTML vs. the DOM
If you look at the DOM elements inside your browser developer tools, you will notice the DOM includes the <h1> element. The DOM of the page is different from the source code - or in other words, the original HTML file you created.

Two side-by-side diagrams showing the differences between the rendered DOM elements and Source Code (HTML)
This is because the HTML represents the initial page content, whereas the DOM represents the updated page content which was changed by the JavaScript code you wrote.

Updating the DOM with plain JavaScript is very powerful but verbose. You've written all this code to add an <h1> element with some text:

index.html

<script type="text/javascript">
  const app = document.getElementById('app');
  const header = document.createElement('h1');
  const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
  const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
  header.appendChild(headerContent);
  app.appendChild(header);
</script>
As the size of an app or team grows, it can become increasingly challenging to build applications this way.

With this approach, developers spend a lot of time writing instructions to tell the computer how it should do things. But wouldn't it be nice to describe what you want to show and let the computer figure out how to update the DOM?

Imperative vs. declarative programming
The code above is a good example of imperative programming. You're writing the steps for how the user interface should be updated. But when it comes to building user interfaces, a declarative approach is often preferred because it can speed up the development process. Instead of having to write DOM methods, it would be helpful if developers were able to declare what they want to show (in this case, an h1 tag with some text).

In other words, imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï

React is a popular declarative library that you can use build user interfaces.

React: A declarative UI library
As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of how to update the DOM on your behalf.

In the next section, we'll explore how you can get started with React.

Chapter 4

Getting Started with React
To use React in your newly created project, load two React scripts from an external website called unpkg.com:

react is the core React library.
react-dom provides DOM-specific methods that enable you to use React with the DOM.
index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      const header = document.createElement('h1');
      const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
      const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
      header.appendChild(headerContent);
      app.appendChild(header);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
Instead of directly manipulating the DOM with plain JavaScript, remove the DOM methods that you had added previously, and add the ReactDOM.createRoot() method to target a specific DOM element and create a root to display your React Components in. Then, add the root.render() method to render your React code to the DOM.

This will tell React to render our <h1> title inside our #app element.

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/jsx">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
      root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
If you try to run this code in the browser, you will get a syntax error:

Terminal

Uncaught SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'
This is because <h1>...</h1> is not valid Javascript. This piece of code is JSX.

What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following three JSX rules, you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML and JavaScript.

But browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a Babel, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.

Adding Babel to your project
To add Babel to your project, copy and paste the following script in your index.html file:

index.html

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
In addition, you will need to inform Babel what code to transform by changing the script type to type=text/jsx.

index.html

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <!-- Babel Script -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/jsx">
      const domNode = document.getElementById('app');
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domNode);
      root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
To confirm it's working correctly, open your HTML file in the browser.

Comparing the declarative React code you just wrote:

index.html

<script type="text/jsx">
  const domNode = document.getElementById("app")
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domNode);
  root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
</script>
to the imperative JavaScript code you wrote in the previous section:

index.html

<script type="text/javascript">
  const app = document.getElementById('app');
  const header = document.createElement('h1');
  const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
  const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
  header.appendChild(headerContent);
  app.appendChild(header);
</script>
You can start to see how using React enables you to cut down a lot of repetitive code.

And this is exactly what React does, it's a library that contains reusable snippets of code that perform tasks on your behalf - in this case, updating the UI.

Additional Resources:

You don't need to know exactly how React updates the UI to start using it, but if you'd like to learn more, here are some additional resources:

UI trees
Writing markup with JSX
react-dom/server sections in the React Documentation.
Essential JavaScript for React
While you can learn JavaScript and React at the same time, being familiar with JavaScript can make the process of learning React easier.

In the next sections, you will be introduced to some core concepts of React from a JavaScript perspective. Here's a summary of the JavaScript topics that will be mentioned:

Functions and Arrow Functions
Objects
Arrays and array methods
Destructuring
Template literals
Ternary Operators
ES Modules and Import / Export Syntax
While this course does not dive into JavaScript, it's good practice to stay up to date with the latest versions of JavaScript. But if you don't feel proficient in JavaScript yet, don't let this hinder you from starting to build with React!

Chapter 5

Building UI with Components
React core concepts
There are three core concepts of React that you'll need to be familiar with to start building React applications. These are:

Components
Props
State
In the next chapters, we will go through these concepts and provide resources where you can continue learning them. After you're familiar with these concepts, we'll then show you how to install Next.js and use newer React features such as Server and Client Components.

Components
User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.

Components allow you to build self-contained, reusable snippets of code. If you think of components as LEGO bricks, you can take these individual bricks and combine them together to form larger structures. If you need to update a piece of the UI, you can update the specific component or brick.

Example of a Media Component made up of 3 smaller components: image, text, and button
This modularity allows your code to be more maintainable as it grows because you can add, update, and delete components without touching the rest of our application.

The nice thing about React components is that they are just JavaScript. Let's see how you can write a React component, from a JavaScript perspective:

Creating components
In React, components are functions. Inside your script tag, create a new function called header:

index.html

<script type="text/jsx">
  const app = document.getElementById("app")
 
  function header() {
  }
 
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
  root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
</script>
A component is a function that returns UI elements. Inside the return statement of the function, you can write JSX:

index.html

<script type="text/jsx">
  const app = document.getElementById("app")
 
  function header() {
     return (<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>)
   }
 
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
  root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
</script>
To render this component to the DOM, pass it as the first argument in the root.render() method:

index.html

<script type="text/jsx">
  const app = document.getElementById("app")
 
  function header() {
     return (<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>)
   }
 
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
  root.render(header);
</script>
But, wait a second. If you try to run the code above in your browser, you'll get an error. To get this to work, there are two things you have to do:

First, React components should be capitalized to distinguish them from plain HTML and JavaScript:

index.html

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
// Capitalize the React Component
root.render(Header);
Second, you use React components the same way you'd use regular HTML tags, with angle brackets <>:

index.html

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
root.render(<Header />);
If you try to run the code in your browser again, you'll see your changes.

Nesting components
Applications usually include more content than a single component. You can nest React components inside each other like you would regular HTML elements.

In your example, create a new component called HomePage:

index.html

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
function HomePage() {
  return <div></div>;
}
 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
root.render(<Header />);
Then nest the <Header> component inside the new <HomePage>component:

index.html

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Nesting the Header component */}
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
root.render(<Header />);
Component trees
You can keep nesting React components this way to form component trees.

Component tree showing how components can be nested inside each other
For example, your top-level HomePage component could hold a Header, an Article, and a Footer Component. And each of those components could in turn have their own child components and so on. For example, the Header component could contain a Logo, Title and Navigation component.

This modular format allows you to reuse components in different places inside your app.

In your project, since <HomePage> is now your top-level component, you can pass it to the root.render() method:

index.html

function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
root.render(<HomePage />);
