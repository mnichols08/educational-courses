## How Does Scrum Work?

Scrum works by taking a problem and breaking it down into smaller chunks.

### Scrum Artifacts

- #### Product Backlog
  A collection of all tasks which must be completed to reach MVP
- #### Sprint Backlog
  Tasks which are of the highest importance will make their way into the Sprint Backlog
- #### Increment
  The time in which the team sets out to work on a project.

### Scrum Events

- #### Sprint Planning
  During this time, the Scrum Team get together to discuss which tasks to prioritize.
- #### Sprint
  A period of time where developers focus on delivering value and achieving a set of goals.
- #### Daily Scrum
  A 15 minute period where the team gets together to discuss progress and challenges.
- #### Sprint Review
  A meeting where the team review the tasks that were completed by the team in the previous sprint
- #### Sprint Retrospective
  A meeting when the team gets together to discuss the things that went well or could be improved from a previous sprint.

### Three Accountabilities

- Product Owner - Goal is to maximize value of product
- Developers
- Scrum Master

Scrum is a mechanism to **optimize** the value **delivery system**.
What is to be done, and how to do it?

#### Scrum in a nutshell

1. PO orders Product Backlog (ideas)
1. Scrum Team define and turn ideas into value during a Sprint
1. Scrum Team and stakeholder inspects the results and adjusts for the next Sprint
1. Repeat

#### Scaled Scrum

1. A **single** PO. A **single** Product Backlog. A **single** Product Goal at a time
1. Scrum Teams self manage
   1. **Do not neeed to synchronize Sprints**
   1. They decide how to handle dependencies

#### Scrum Team

- **Self-mangaged** and cross-functional
- No sub-teams or hierarchies
- Collective accountability
  _ All product related activities
  _ Valueable, usable increment, each Sprint
  <ins>Accountabilities</ins>
  Typically, 10 or fewer members
- Scrum Master
  - Faciliatator
  - Causes Impediment removal
- Product Owner
  - Value maximizer
- Developers Create any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint
  <ins>Self-managed</ins>
- Internally decide who does **what**, **when**, and **how**.
  <ins>Cross-functional</ins>
- Have all the skills to create value each Sprint.

#### During the Sprint

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality goals do not decrease
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed
- Scope maybe be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and Developers as more is learned.
- Only **Product Owner** can **cancel** it.

#### Product Backlog

- Only one
- Only one Product Goal
- Estimated by Developers
- Refinedby Scrum Team. Continuously.
- Pursue one Product Goal at a time.

#### Events

Formal opportunities for Inspect & Adapt

If not, mutually defined by Scrum Teams.
