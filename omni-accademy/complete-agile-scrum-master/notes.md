## What is Scrum?

A mechanism to **optimize** the **value** delivery system
There is a point where something becomes chaotic and a sweet spot where it is not too complex or simple just does what it needs to do exactly how its needs to happen.

A mechanisim to **guide changes**

-> Change -> Work -> Inspect result -> Prioritize improvements -> Adapt -> Work -> New improvement -> Becomes -> Old -> Repeat

## Agility means **responding to change**

## How did Agile emerge?

SCRUM DSDM ASD to FDD CRYSTAL CLEAR

###### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over process and tools
- Working software over comphrehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan
- That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

    - **Others might do work related to Product Backlog management**, but the **Product Owner remains accountable**
    - Product Owner must have authority

##### Question

- Should the Development Team be composed by Generalists or Specialists?
  *One of the main reasons for agile teams not having cohesion is the lack of redundancy. That is, having highly specialized developers generates islands of knowledge. In other words, lack of collaboration

Specialists are often necessary, but it is important to have generalists.

One solution: Cross training.*
