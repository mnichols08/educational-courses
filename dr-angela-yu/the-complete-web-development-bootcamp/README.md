## FAQs

Q: What is the difference between your online and in-person bootcamp?
A: The online bootcamp on Udemy has the same curriculum as our in-person bootcamp. Our in-person bootcamp only runs once per year and is wait-list based. The Udemy online course can be taken at anytime, on your schedule.

Q: What's the difference between your online courses on Udemy andappbrewery.com?
A: Since 2019, we have moved all our courses on to Udemy other than some courses with prior contracts (e.g. the agreement with have with Google for the Flutter course). You should get our courses from Udemy

Q: How long does the bootcamp take to complete?
A: We teach the course in person over 12 weeks. But we have seen students online complete the course as quickly as 3 weeks. It depends if you are going to work full-time or part-time. It can also be helpful to read around the topics and do more self-directed research and experimentation.

Q: I don't have any prior experience or a technical background, can I join the bootcamp?
A: The course is designed for students of all levels. The youngest person we've had on the course is 11, the oldest 86. The most inexperienced student didn't know what a website is, the most experienced works for Twitter as a developer. The most important thing is perseverance and willingness to learn. If you have that then you'll do great!
