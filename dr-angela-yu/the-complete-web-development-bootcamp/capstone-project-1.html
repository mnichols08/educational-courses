    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3>SOUTHERN AUTO SUPPLY</h3>
    October 2021 - Present<br />
    <em>A small town auto parts store with around ten employees.</em>
    <h4>Sales Associate</h4>
    <p>
      A non-technical job to pay the bills while I search for an entry-level
      position in development.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Excellent Communication:</strong> Utilize questions to establish
        an effective line of communication with the customer to determine their
        needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strong Attention to Detail:</strong> Beyond communication
        skills, a sales associate at a parts store must recognize the importance
        of key differences between parts and vehicles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Experienced Web Developer:</strong> Wrote a small app for
        counting my drawer at the end of day as well as a random lunch picker to
        help us pick lunch and even an app I called tick.it
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RIX RACING</h3>
    September 2019 - May 2021<br />
    <em>An automotive performance shop with only a handful of employees.</em>
    <h4>Shipping & Logistics Manager</h4>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Strong Attention to Detail:</strong> Many parts that were sold
        did not have any label or inventory information. It was important to pay
        attention to details and take accurate notes to accurately describe
        items online.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HIGH MOUNTAIN SPORTS</h3>
    October 2011 - September 2019<br />
    <em>A small sporting goods retail store with around twenty employees.</em>

      Essentially created this position while working as a sales associate

      <li>
        <strong>Google Ads & Analytics:</strong> Obtain certifications and then
        analyze ad spend, finally dispatched an effective campaign to reduce

        a whole lot more including SQL.
