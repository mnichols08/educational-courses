# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML? Hyper Text Markup Language
- Hyper Text is essentially the data within a html tag
- Markup Language is essentially the semantic style portion
## [Headings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)
The `<h1>` to `<h6>` HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

## [Paragraphs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)
`<p>`: The Paragraph element
The `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing `</p>` tag. See "Tag omission" below.

## Self Closing Tags
Void Elements are elements that are forbidden from generating any content whatsoever suchas a horizontal rule `<hr />`
