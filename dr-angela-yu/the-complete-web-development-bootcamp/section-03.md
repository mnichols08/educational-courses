The `<ol>` HTML element represents an ordered list of items â€” typically rendered as a numbered list.
## [Unordered Lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)
`<ul>`: The Unordered List element
The `<ul>` HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
## [List Items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li)
`<li>`: The List Item element
The `<li>` HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (`<ol>`), an unordered list (`<ul>`), or a menu (`<menu>`). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.

## Nesting and Indentation
We can nest lists inside of lists or really any number of many combinations.
This allows us to really add structure to our documents
