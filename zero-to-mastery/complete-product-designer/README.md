# Become a Designer in 2023! Master Mobile and Web Design, User Interface + User Experience (UI/UX Design), HTML, and CSS

# Meeting the Client
We assume we have met the client and already have work at this stage of the course.

# Designer vs Developer
A designer's goals are aligned with the user experience and they support developers by providing them with useful information from the planning stage. But their job isn't over when development begins, it only pauses. Their work begins again after the app is developed and users begin using the app. They begin to iterate te process over again by revisting the design. This course is dedicated to creating a good designer and doesn't focus on coding that much. No worries from me XD
