# Figma Basics

Figma is a free tool - with paid plans available - which allows us to create amazing User Interfaces, prototypes, all in a collaborative environemnt centered around going from design files to code!
Figjam is another tool within Figma which allows user to create diagrams on the fly for brainstorming
Figma and Figjam are just amazing for getting feedback.
Components are very powerful features that let us prototype app functionality and reuse them throughout a design file
All code can be converted to assets or css whatever is needed.
Another great thing about Figma is the amount of resources that are available directly within the community. This includes plugins and much more.
The pricing plans for Figma are Free | Pro | Organization (Pro is free for students and Educators) Zero To Academy is an acceptable form of "school" to pass this eligibility requirement.
Figma is available for mobile, desktop, and web.

# Structure Of Dashboard
The dashboard is the menu presnted upon initial loading of Figma. This includes account settings, an overview of your projects. You can find recent projects on the left sidebar along with drafts. Try to name you pojects appropriately.

You can star any file which adds it to your favorites and makes it appear on the left panel

Files in Figma can be a little tricky to understand but using the resouces available in this course will help you be successful.

We want to open up Figma Basics file given to us and create a duplicate draft of the original.
