# The Two Pillars

* Remember functions in javascript are also objects.
  When we invoke a function, we get two parameters automatically. The `this` keyword and `arguments` object. When we define our function and the compiler looks at our code lexically - it adds our variables and scope chains.

  Functions are First Class Citizens in JS

  * We can assign functions to a variable

  * We can pass functions as arguments to other functions

  * Can return functions as values from other functions

  * Opens Javascript up to the world of Functional Progamming

  * Careful with initiliazing functions inside of loops. It is much better to be outside of the loop.
