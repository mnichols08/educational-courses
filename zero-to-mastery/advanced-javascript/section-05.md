# The Two Pillars

* Remember functions in javascript are also objects.
  When we invoke a function, we get two parameters automatically. The `this` keyword and `arguments` object. When we define our function and the compiler looks at our code lexically - it adds our variables and scope chains.

## Closures

## Prototypal Inheritance

## Higher Order Functions

## Functions vs Objects

## Scheme + Java
