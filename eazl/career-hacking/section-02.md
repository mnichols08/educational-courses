# Resumes in a World of AI and Applicant Tracking Systems

Resumes are certainly not the most popular thing to write or come up with - but they are incredibly powerful and necessary in the job search.
Many times our resumes are fed through something called a Applicant Tracking System, which is a tool that a lot of recruiters use to find the best applicants for the roles.

So what skills are organizations looking for?
Well they look at your resume for about six seconds before putting it in the interested file or the trash.

## Super Charge The Body of Your Resume
Integrate brands, details, and quantities. Think about journalistic questions like who, what, when, why, and how. Who were your employer's customers? what did you do? When, why, how?

Here's an example workflow to use to build content for your resume:

1. Think about your most-recent career-related experience. What part of that experience was most important?
- I am currently back to working as a sales associate. I want to get back into tech
2. Now, try to align what was most important in that experience with your highest-priority Big Six Skill. You may have to reframe the experience for it to fit a Big Six Skill. If it can’t align, move to a lower-priority skill.
- I wrote an app
3. When it does align, describe your part in that experience and integrate brands, quantities, and details into your description. Take notes of your work. This is a draft bulletpoint that you can use on your resume.
3. Repeat this workflow going back for your career history for up to 10 years. Your goal is to have 2-3 bulletpoints for each experience listed on your resume. Each bulletpoint needs to align with one of your Big Six Skills.
4. If you can, you should try to find at least one bulletpoint for each of your Big Six Skills to include somewhere in your resume. However, sometimes this is not possible. It is essential that you are able to develop at least one bulletpoint for each of your top 3 Big Six Skills.
- Remember, you may have to reframe some part of your experience to fit with your Big Six Skill or  modify your Big Six Skill so that the experience fits better.
